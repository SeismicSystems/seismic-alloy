# Seismic Alloy

This repository contains Seismic's fork of Alloy

The upstream repository lives [here](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy). This fork is up-to-date with it through commit `de01884`. You can see this by viewing the [main](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-alloy/tree/main) branch on this repository

You can view all of our changes vs. upstream on this [pull request](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-alloy/pull/2). The sole purpose of this PR is display our diff; it will never be merged in to the main branch of this repo

## Main Changes

### Seismic Transaction Type

This new EIP-2718 transaction type (`0x4a` or `74`) introduces additional fields that Seismic uses to secure its blockchain.

#### Fields

- **encryption_pubkey**  
  Represents the EOA's ephemerally generated public key. **Note:** This is _not_ the public key associated with the Ethereum address. When a Seismic transaction is sent to the chain, its calldata is encrypted using a shared secret derived from the network's key and the ephemeral key. This shared secret is included in the transaction so the network can decrypt the EOA's calldata (located in the `input` field, as with other transactions).

- **message_version**  
  Determines the method used to send the transaction. Seismic currently supports two approaches:

  1. **Standard Method:**  
     The transaction is signed using `signTransaction` and sent as raw transaction bytes (indicated by `0`).

  2. **EIP-712 Typed Data:**  
     The transaction is sent as EIP-712 signed typed data (indicated by `2`).

  > **Note:**  
  > We added support for EIP-712 because browser extension wallets couldnâ€™t sign Seismic transactions using the traditional method. This support might be removed in the future. The value `1` is reserved for supporting transactions signed via `personal_sign` (for example, by hardware wallets).

### New Enums for Seismic RPC Extensions

Seismic extends Ethereum's RPC methods by introducing two new enums:

- `SeismicCallRequest` for `eth_call`
- `SeismicRawTxRequest` for `eth_sendRawTransaction`

#### SeismicCallRequest

On Seismic, you can perform an `eth_call` in two ways:

- **Standard Call:**  
  Submit a transaction request normally. However, if you set the `from` field, it will be overridden to the zero address to prevent users from making calls from addresses they do not own.

- **Signed Call:**  
  Submit a transaction request accompanied by a signature. In this case, the `from` field is populated with the signer's address and passed to smart contracts, ensuring that `msg.sender` cannot be spoofed. A signed call can be made using either:

  - A raw transaction payload (e.g., bytes)
  - EIP-712 signed typed data (to support browser wallets)

#### SeismicRawTxRequest

For sending a raw transaction on Seismic, you have two options:

- **Standard Method:**  
  Use raw transaction bytes.
- **EIP-712 Method:**  
  Send the transaction using EIP-712 signed typed data, as discussed in the `message_version` section.

### New Provider for Shielded Transaction

- When a TxSeismic transaction is created, we:
  1. Generate an ephemeral key pair
  2. Use the ephemeral private key and network's public key to generate a shared secret via ECDH
  3. Use the shared secret to encrypt the transaction's calldata
  4. Include the ephemeral public key in the transaction so the network can decrypt the calldata
- Support for decrypting `eth_call` output. When a signed `eth_call` is made, the network encrypts the output using the ephemeral public key provided in the request. The client can then decrypt this output using the ephemeral private key it generated
- Please see `create_seismic_provider` for detailed provider configuration for shielded transaction.

## Structure

Seismic's forks of the [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) stack all have the same branch structure:

- `main` or `master`: this branch only consists of commits from the upstream repository. However it will rarely be up-to-date with upstream. The latest commit from this branch reflects how recently Seismic has merged in upstream commits to the seismic branch
- `seismic`: the default and production branch for these repositories. This includes all Seismic-specific code essential to make our network run
